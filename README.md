# News Site

This is a middle earth news web site, enjoy the read!

## The problem

I had and still have the problem of understanding how html and CSS elements and properties really work.
I did the content of the web page in the last minute and I didn't really figured out how to show the news in a proper way in the mobile screens.

I have google a lot, I have seen many videos from youtube and asket quite a lot to ChatGPT too.

If I could have more time, I would like to fix the site on the mobile screen query.

Improve the footer with some icons.

And improve the navigation bar and the links with some fancy moving elements when hover over them.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
